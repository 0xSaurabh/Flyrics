## How it Works

Flyrics uses an Artifical Intelligence and a Machine Language approach to generate lyrics on the fly. The project is divided into a backend (python & flask) and a frontend (react native). The user is able to either record a sample of a song, or upload an already existing file in the frontend. The frontend then communicates with the flask server in the backend which is responsible for all of the processing. This processing includes the usage of a python library spleeter which uses a trained model to separate the vocals from the song that was inputted. The vocals are then slowed down in order to increase speech recognition accuracy. The slowed file is passed on to Google's Speech-to-Text API which handles the conversion of the vocals into text. The result is a JSON object which is passed back to the frontend. Finally, the result is displayed in the frontend and the files that were created in the backend are deleted to save disk space.

## Getting Started

The process of getting started is twofold, and is described below.

#### Cloning The Repo
1. Make sure you have git installed on your computer.
2. Run the following command to clone the repo: ```git clone https://github.com/AhadKhan98/Flyrics.git```


#### Firing Up The Backend Server
1. Browse into the ```flask-backend``` folder.
2. Make sure you have python3 and pip installed.
3. Install dependencies using the following command:
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` OR ``` pip3 install -r requirements.txt ```
4. Run the following command to start the server: ```python main.py``` OR ```python3 main.py```
5. If you see a message like the one below, you have successfully started the backend server.
